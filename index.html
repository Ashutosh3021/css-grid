        <h1>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects | learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</h1>
        <p>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed op for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.</p>
